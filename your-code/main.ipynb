    "## Objective\n",
    "In this exercise, you will work in pairs to simulate the process of deploying code from a development environment (DEV) to a production environment (PRD). One student will act as the developer pushing code, while the other will be the gatekeeper ensuring the code runs correctly.\n",

    "### Step 1: Form Pairs\n",
    "- Done.\n",

    "### Step 2: Developer Role\n",
    "1. **Push Code to Repository**\n",
    "   - all done\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create a Pull Request**\n",
    "   - done.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Gatekeeper Role\n",
    "1. **Review and Pull Code**\n",
    "   - done.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Setup Environment**\n",
    "   - works\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Run the Project**\n",
    "   - all good.!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Swap Roles and Repeat\n",
    "- done and dusted\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes\n",
    "- Ensure clear communication between partners during the process.\n",
    "- Make use of version control best practices.\n",
    "- Document any issues encountered and how they were resolved.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deliverables\n",
    "- Each pair should have a functioning project that has been successfully reviewed, pulled, and run by the gatekeeper.\n",
    "- A brief report on the process, any challenges faced, and how they were overcome.\n",
    "\n",
